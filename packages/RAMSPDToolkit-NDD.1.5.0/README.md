A toolkit for accessing RAMs SPD. Primarily used for reading temperature and data from SPD.<br/>
Reading from SPD is standardized by [JEDEC](https://www.jedec.org/), for the most part.<br/>

### Warning - writing via SMBus and to SPD is dangerous
It is possible and supported to write data via SMBus, but **NOT recommended** and **dangerous** for your hardware.<br/>
You can also write data to the SPD via SMBus, when write protection is disabled, which is also **NOT recommended.**<br/>
Doing so **COULD** brick whatever hardware you're writing to, rendering that hardware part useless.<br/>
Writing to something you should not write to means: this piece of hardware **WILL** be [a rock,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)) once again.<br/>
Do this at your own risk and only if you know what you are doing.

You can download the latest release [from here.](https://github.com/Blacktempel/RAMSPDToolkit/releases)

## How can I help improve the project ?
Feel free to give feedback and contribute to our project !<br/>
Pull requests are welcome. Please include as much information as possible.

## Developer information
**Integrate the library in your own application**

**Sample code**
```C#
static class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        //You can enable logging and set level, if you need logging output
        Logger.Instance.IsEnabled = true;
        Logger.Instance.LogLevel = LogLevel.Trace;

        //Check for Windows OS and load driver
        if (OperatingSystem.IsWindows())
        {
            //Load driver
            if (DriverManager.LoadDriver(DriverImplementation.WinRing0)) //use WinRing0 driver
            //if (DriverManager.LoadDriver(DriverImplementation.PawnIO)) //use PawnIO driver
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"***** Driver {DriverManager.DriverImplementation} is open. *****");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"***** DRIVER ERROR *****");
                throw new Exception("Driver is not open.");
            }
        }

        //Detect SMBuses
        SMBusManager.DetectSMBuses();

        //Go through available SMBuses
        foreach (var bus in SMBusManager.RegisteredSMBuses)
        {
            //Go through possible RAM slots
            for (byte i = SPDConstants.SPD_BEGIN; i <= SPDConstants.SPD_END; i++)
            {
                //Detect what kind of RAM we have
                var detector = new SPDDetector(bus, i);

                //We have a RAM stick here
                if (detector.IsValid)
                {
                    if (detector.Accessor is IThermalSensor ts)
                    {
                        //Get temperature, if possible
                        if (ts.HasThermalSensor && ts.UpdateTemperature())
                        {
                            //Output temperature for detected RAM sticks
                            Console.WriteLine($"DIMM #{i - SPDConstants.SPD_BEGIN}: {ts.Temperature}°C / {TemperatureConverter.CelsiusToFahrenheit(ts.Temperature)}°F.");
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        //Check for Windows before unloading driver
        if (OperatingSystem.IsWindows())
        {
            //Unload the driver - this removes extracted driver files and unloads them
            DriverManager.Driver.Unload();
            Console.WriteLine("***** Closed driver *****");
        }

        //Save log file to current directory, if you enabled logging output
        Logger.Instance.SaveToFile("Log.txt", false);

        //All done
        Console.WriteLine("Press enter to exit...");
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

**Administrator rights**

Some functionality requires administrator privileges to access the data.<br/>
Consider adding a manifest file to your application and set ``requestedExecutionLevel`` to ``requireAdministrator``.

### Can I use my own driver ?
Yes, you can implement your own driver. This can be done using our IGenericDriver interface.<br/>
If you will be using any of our pre-defined drivers you will find specific interfaces for them aswell, which you can implement.<br/>
Whatever you do, please be sure to use a well tested driver.<br/>
New driver suggestions are welcome. Please open an issue on the repository and we will check.

### NDD Build / Package (No Default Driver[s])
We also provide a version without any internal driver implementation or binaries.
You can change compilation configuration for that or use the NDD package.
